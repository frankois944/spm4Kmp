### Example


!!! warning

    When using `includeProduct`, a local package is created, and you will see the following message in the build output.
    ```
    Spm4Kmp: The following dependencies [some_dependency_name] need to be added to your xcode project
    A local Swift package has been generated at
    /path/to/the/local/package
    Please add it to your xcode project as a local package dependency; it will add the missing content.
    ****You can ignore this messaging if you have already added these dependencies to your Xcode project****
    ```

```kotlin
swiftPackageConfig {
    create("dummy") {
        // Manually include the KeychainAccess library
        exportedPackageSettings { includeProduct = listOf("KeychainAccess") }
        dependency {
            remotePackageBranch(
                url = URI("https://github.com/krzyzanowskim/CryptoSwift.git"),
                branch = "main",
                products = {
                    add(
                        ProductName(
                            "CryptoSwift"
                        ), // will not be included inside the exported package
                    )
                },
            )

                    ), // will be included inside the exported package
                products = { add("KeychainAccess") },
