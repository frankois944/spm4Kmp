# Export Dependencies To Kotlin

On completion with [using external dependencies](bridgeWithDependencies.md), it's possible to export them to Kotlin, if they are compatible.

Exported dependency can be used inside the bridge and the Kotlin app.

!!! note

    If your package doesn't work with the plugin, please create an [issue](https://github.com/frankois944/spm4Kmp/issues).

## Gradle

The following configuration export to Kotlin the package [FirebaseAnalytics](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk) which is a ObjC library.

You can try to export a pure Swift library, but only basic ObjC will be available.

``` kotlin title="build.gradle.kts"
swiftPackageConfig {
    create("[cinteropName]") {
        dependency(
            SwiftDependency.Package.Remote.Version(
                url = URI("https://github.com/firebase/firebase-ios-sdk.git"),
                products = {
                    add("FirebaseAnalytics", exportToKotlin = true), // exported
                    add("FirebaseCore") // non-exported
                },
                version = "11.8.0",
            )
        )
    }
}
```

!!! warning

    A local swift package is being generated during the build and this message diplayed
    ```
    Spm4Kmp: A local Swift package has been generated at
    /path/to/the/local/package
    Please add it to your xcode project as a local package dependency.
    ```
    Add the folder to your Xcode project as a Local package, that's all.

    Note : When updating your configuration, reset the package cache to apply the modification.

## Example

``` kotlin title="iosMain/kotlin/com/example/myKotlinFile.kt"
import FirebaseAnalytics.FIRConsentStatusGranted

@ExperimentalForeignApi
val consentStatusGranted = FIRConsentStatusGranted

```

!!! note

    The bridge can remain empty as we don't need it; we only want to use the exported product.
