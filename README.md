The Swift Package Manager for Kotlin Multiplatform Plugin, aka `spmForKmp` Gradle Plugin, is an **alternative of the [dying](https://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-Specs-Repo/) CocoaPods Plugin** used by [KMP cocoapods plugin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/native-cocoapods.html#set-up-an-environment-to-work-with-cocoapods).

It will help you to integrate Swift Package and simplify communication between Swift/Kotlin Multiplatform projects targeting the **Apple platform**.

The plugin uses the embedded Swift Package Manager, so **no third-party dependency is needed**, and it's less intrusive.
